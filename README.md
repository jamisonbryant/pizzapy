# PizzaPy

A collection of scripts that I wrote to help me study for my amateur radio (HAM)
license, technician class. Then name comes from HAM plus "py"-napple, my
all-time favorite kind of pizza.

## Organization

The scripts are organized into subdirectories based on type. Each subdirectory
should have a README file that describes its contents and any dependencies that
the scripts may have.
